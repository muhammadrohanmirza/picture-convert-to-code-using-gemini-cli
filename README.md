After giving this prompt, the Gemini CLI has made this.

Convert the uploaded image into a fully responsive HTML and CSS landing page hero section that looks exactly like the 
Canva design shown. The page should include a top navigation bar with the “Canva” logo text on the left, navigation 
links for Design, Product, Plans, Business, Education, and Help in the center or right, and two buttons — “Sign up”
 and “Log in” — aligned on the right side. Below the navbar, create a hero section with a large, centered heading that
 says “A new era of imagination” and a smaller subheading that reads “Discover a whole new world of skills and tools 
designed to put your imagination to work.” Under the text, include two call-to-action buttons labeled “Start designing 
for free” and “Explore our launches.” The background must use a smooth vertical gradient transitioning from
 purple (#8b4cf8) at the top to cyan (#00c4cc) at the bottom, exactly matching the image colors. Use a modern
 sans-serif font, balanced spacing, and smooth hover transitions on buttons. Make sure the design is completely 
responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices while maintaining accurate typography, layout, and color tones.
 The final output should include clean, semantic HTML5 and CSS3 code in separate sections, with no JavaScript, and the 
structure should be well-organized and properly commented.
